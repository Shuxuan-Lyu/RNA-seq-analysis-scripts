This branch includes two R scripts of snRNA-seq data downstream analysis whcih are related to the 'Jam3-enriched myelinated DANs' project.
The 'Mice midbrain snRNA-seq script submission' file was used to analyze snRNA-seq data of midbrain cells dissected from the sham and MPTP treated mice.
The 'nn Human SNc snRNA-seq script submission' file was used to re-analyze the snRNA-seq data of human SNc cells obtained from the study ‘Kamath T et al. Single-cell genomic profiling of human dopamine neurons identifies a population that selectively degenerates in Parkinson's disease. Nat Neurosci, 2022.’
